# ecommerce-app
This e-commerce app was built using Django and Django REST framework for the back-end and React.js for the front-end.

## Functionality:
In this app, users can view the products, including price image and stock level.
In addition, users can add reviews to each product with review text and number of stars.
Products and reviews are stored in the server-side SQLite database.

## Instructions:
- Git clone the repository onto your local machine
- Alternatively, download the zip file, unzip and open in Visual Studio Code
- Navigate to the root ecommerce-app folder and use the command `pip install -r requirements` to install the relevant packages
- You may need to install pip if you do not have this on your machine (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Once the requirements are installed, use `python manage.py runserver` to launch the backend
- Navigate to the frontend folder
- Use `npm install` then `npm start` to launch the application
- You may need to install node / npm if the command is not recognised
- You should now be able to view and interact with the application
